    details: "Social Scandinavian dancing, mostly to live music. The evening is a blend of gammaldans (waltz, hambo, schottis….) and bygdedans (polskas and springars). Requests are honored if at all possible. Partners are not necessary, but we strongly recommend wearing hard-soled shoes, as it makes the dances both easier and more fun. There is no dance during the summer months, June, July, and August."
