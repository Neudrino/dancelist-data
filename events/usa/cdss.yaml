From a handful of fiddle members, we have grown into a band with typically eight members who play fiddle, banjo, guitar, piano, mandolin, whistle, bass and percussion.\nCaller: Don Heinold. Hailing from Rhode Island, Don has been calling at dances, weddings & parties all over New England for over 14 years. Don is also known for teaching the rotary (country) waltz.\nAdmission: Suggested donation: $5 per person / $20 per couple or family / children under 3 free.

    details: "English country dancing runs the gamut from sublime to silly, from elegant to energetic, and the dance repertoire draws from over 350 years of material. Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "English country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \n​Recorded Music: $12 General | $10 Members | $7 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21) \n\n\n\n\n​“Pay What You Want” first seven days of every month (1st through the 7th) – Newcomers especially encouraged to attend!"

We invite you to come and share their musical journey with us through music and dance.\nScholarship Program: This year we are also restarting the scholarship program for new and developing callers. It is an opportunity to learn about the traditional dance and participate in our Callers’ Showcase. To apply, send an email to info@ralphpage.neffa.org.\nThe Ralph Page Dance Event Committee: Chair: Tod Whittemore. Members: Paul Lizotte (Program), Don Heinold (Publicity), Matt Burke, Justin Godin, Richard Hart, Sandy Lafleur, Gary Nielsen, Andy Taylor-Blenis\nNotes: The Ralph Page Dance Legacy Weekend began in 1988 to recognize the contributions that Ralph Page made to contra and New England folk dancing. Ralph Page (1903-1985) was known as “the dean of contra dance callers.” He almost single-handedly kept contra dancing alive in the United States when many had abandoned their local dances for that new invention, the television. Page was a dance organizer, band leader, caller, author, and recording artist as well as a leader of weekly dances and dance camps.\n\nPage was one of the founders of the New England Folk Festival Association and served as its president from 1960-1963. The New Hampshire Library of Traditional Music and Dance is the site to which Ralph Page donated his archives.\nThe Ralph Page Dance Legacy Weekend presents traditional New England contra and square dancing as Page did it, along with modern dance styles as well.\n\n\nClothing & Footwear: Just bring, clean shoes to dance in to preserve the floor (no high heels please). Dress is comfortable and as you like.\nRole Terms are: “Ladies & Gents” but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role that works for them as has been done over the years."

    details: "In a contra dance, a leader, known as a caller, teaches basic dance steps during an introductory “walk-through” of the dance. Dancers learn by walking through the steps and formations, following the caller’s instructions. The dance figures are similar to those of old-time square dancing, except the figures are usually danced in a line, with leaders and followers facing each other. \n​These dances are lively, social, easy to learn, and aerobic. Although you will dance with a partner, it isn’t necessary to come with one. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” (partners facing in long lines down the hall).  Many of the regular Tapestry Folkdance Center contra bands play old-time music (similar to bluegrass), but the music at any given Saturday night contra may reflect a range of music traditions, such as New England, French Canadian, Irish, Scottish, Cape Breton, and modern compositions."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

    details: "2nd Sunday of the Month: \nLive Music with Anytime English Players \nEnglish country dancing is an accessible social dance form with a history going back several centuries. This is the dancing of Queen Elizabeth I, of Jane Austen, and a living tradition that inspires musical compositions and choreographies today. The music can be stately or sprightly, traditional or modern, recorded or live. It is danced with simple walking or skipping steps in time to the music. All dances are taught and are usually done in “long-ways sets” with partners facing in lines down the hall. After a walk-through, the easy-to-learn figures are called throughout the dance as you interact with other couples in your set and then move on to the next and repeat.\n​\nYou can come by yourself and be assured of dancing throughout the evening, since our tradition is to welcome and teach beginners and change partners for each dance. Anyone can invite anyone else to dance, regardless of gender or experience.  English country dance will satisfy your wish for pleasurable exercise, a warm social community, mental stimulation, or even transcendent aesthetic experiences. We invite you to join us! \nLive Music: $15 General | $12 Member | $8 Young Adult & Youth (Ages 10 -21)"
