We dance to the fiddle tunes of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, and Appalachia and we often switch partners after every dance so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time!\nCaller: Tod Whittemore from Connecticut, Tod has been calling dances for forty years, having been lucky enough to begin his career at the time when famous callers Ralph Page and Duke Miller were still active in the Monadnock Region. Tod has called dances all over the world, and is known for his humor, energy, and infectious love of dancing!\nLive Music by Dogtown, featuring Becky Miller (fiddle), Norb Spencer (accordion), and Avi Randall (keyboards). They play a mix of New England, French Canadian, Scottish, and Quebecois dance tunes, as well as old time southern dance tunes and sung calls. They are a highly desired band to play at contra dances!\nAdmission: $10 adults, $7 students. Donations gratefully accepted!\nHomemade pie slices! This month we offer pumpkin pie and other kinds of fall pies! These delicious pie slices are offered at the break for $3/slice to help support the band and caller.\nRole Terms are “Ladies & Gents” (or Women & Men), but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role their heart desires.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual; layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged, but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder).\nParking: Plenty of parking in the large parking area next to the building!"
