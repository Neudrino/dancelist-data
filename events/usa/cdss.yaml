  - name: Playford Ball with Andrew Swaine and the Warleggan Village Band
    details: "Save the date – join us for live music from the Warleggan Village Band and dancing led by Andrew Swaine. \nRichard Heacock (violin), Matthew Coatsworth (violin and concertina) and Chris Green (guitar) formed the Warleggan Village Band to play for dance sequences in BBC TV’s Poldark, and later in the hugely successful Netflix series Bridgerton. The band is renowned for its exceptionally inventive playing of English country dance music from Playford to Regency times, bringing joy and energy to dancers and listeners alike.  \nAs well as performing for The Dancing Master’s Playford Ball, the Warleggan Village Band have provided audio examples of music displayed in the exhibition. \nAndrew Swaine is one of the most respected callers in the country, whether for ceilidh, American contra or Playford. His research into early Playford dances made him an obvious choice to lead dancers at our Playford Ball. Andrew runs Playford in the Pub, a monthly music and dance session held in The Shakespeare Pub in Sheffield.  \nBooking for the ball will open in autumn 2023."
