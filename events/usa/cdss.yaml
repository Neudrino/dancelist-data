Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance.

Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18. Call 707-829-3478 for more information or contact kalia@nbcds.org \nNote: We sometimes need to make a venue or time change to accommodate special events. Please check the NBCDS calendar to confirm."

    details: "Yes, we have a new name! The Mystic Pie Dance!\nTime: Dance 7:30-10:30 pm [short basics session @ 7:15 pm]\nThis is so wicked fun! It is the most fun you can have with your clothes on! We dance to live music—the fiddle tunes of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Appalachia, and America. We often switch partners after every dance, so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time!\nLive Music by The Dead Sea Squirrels. Don’t be fooled by the unlikely name—you’re gonna love dancing to Cathy Mason on fiddle; Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, and mandolin (but not all at the same time!); and Henry Yoshimura on guitar. They play widely for contra dances and are known for their danceable tunes arranged in medleys designed to closely match and enhance the movements of the particular contra dance being taught/called. They tend to push the boundaries of the southern style with fiddle and fiddle/guitar harmonies!\nCaller: Paul Wilde from RI. Paul was a schoolteacher for 16 years and said that his classroom experience helped him to develop his calling skills on the dance floor.\nAdmission: $10 adults, $7 students. Donations gratefully accepted!\nHomemade Pie Slices! This month we offer pumpkin pie and other kinds of fall pies! These delicious pie slices are offered at the break for $3/slice to help support the band and caller.\nRole Terms are: “Ladies & Gents” (or Women & Men) but dancers are welcome to choose whatever role their heart desires.\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual, layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneaker are discouraged but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder).\nParking: Plenty of parking in the large parking area next to the building!"

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "Time: Dance 7:30-10:30pm [short basics session 7:15 pm]\nThis is so wicked fun! We dance to the fiddle tunes of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Appalachia & America! We often switch partners after every dance so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time! So come enjoy the friendly camaraderie, dance to live music and see everyone’s smiling faces!\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual; layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged).\nFood: Some snacks offered at the break and contributions are welcome and needed!\nCaller: George Thomson. George is a traditional New England dance leader, calling fun, easy, and family-friendly circles dances, squares, and longways sets for barn and contra dances. He enjoys calling singing squares in the style of the late Ralph Sweet. He also plays the great highland bagpipes!.\nLive Music: The Dead Sea Squirrels. Don’t be fooled by the unlikely name: You’re gonna love dancing to Cathy Mason on fiddle; Craig Edwards on fiddle, banjo, and mandolin (but not all at the same time!); and Henry Yoshimura on guitar. They play widely for contra dances and are known for their danceable tunes arranged in medleys designed to closely match and enhance the movements of the particular contra dance being taught/called. They tend to push the boundaries of the southern style with fiddle and fiddle/guitar harmonies!\nAdmission: $13.00 per person OR students (with ID, please) pay $6. Donations are greatly appreciated and encouraged!\nFree Parking: There is plenty of free parking right in front of the hall.\nRole Terms: “Ladies & Gents” but all dancers are welcome to dance whichever role their heart desires."

Our series offers delectable live music and skilled callers from the Bay Area and beyond. You can come by yourself or with friends, since we change partners after each dance. If you’ve ever done contra or square dancing, much of our dance vocabulary will be familiar to you since both of those styles evolved from English country dancing. \nThe dance is held the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month, 2-4:30 pm, to live music, all levels of experience welcome; and occasional 5th Sundays for Advanced dancers. Admission is $15 for members of NBCDS and its affiliates, $8 for young adults ages 19-30, and $3 for youth ages 6-18.

    details: "How do I love ECD? Let me count the ways….\nThere is something for everyone!\nSome people love ECD for the music—we dance to beautiful tunes taken from classical arrangements, old ballads, and the modern era. Others love ECD for its uncomplicated moves that are chained together to form intricate, lyrical patterns. And almost everyone loves ECD for the communal dance experience, which can be energizing, mesmerizing, and just plain fun! \nNo dance partner necessary!\nDon’t have a dance partner to bring with you? No problem! Just come alone. ECDA culture is that couples change partners at the end of every dance and no one sits out unless they want to. \nNo experience necessary!\nNever tried this before? No problem! Unlike in the movies, every ECDA dance starts with a walkthrough, during which the caller teaches the dancers what to do, and then continues to “Call” (give instruction and prompt the moves) throughout the entire dance. And, like other new skills, the terminology and moves used in ECD get easier with time and practice. Regular ECDA dances are beginner friendly and the atmosphere is supportive of new dancers. \nNo fancy uniforms!\nYou may have seen ECD on TV before but English Country Dance in the 21st century is not all Regency Balls and period costumes (although there is certainly a time and a place for that—check out these suggestions for the Saturday night Ball at each year’s Fandango! dance weekend). No special clothing is needed for our regular ECDA dances other than clean, soft-soled shoes that won’t scruff up the dance floor. \nSee for yourself. Here are clips of a group of ECDA dancers practicing in advance for the Saturday night Ball to be held during Fandango! 2015. Clips show the “walk through” and then the dance itself with calling by Everett Lunsford and music by ‘Round Robbin: Robbin Marcus (piano), Dave Marcus (concertina), and Meredith Doster (flute)."

    details: "We typically dance on the 2nd & 4th Sunday of each month. \nFor years, the Hayward Contra has drawn dancers from all over the Bay Area and beyond. \nSome of the unique features that have drawn a loyal following are: \nHayward is centrally located and the venue, The Hill and Valley Club, 1808 ‘B’ Street, Hayward, CA, is easy to reach by BART or car. \nAs a weekend dance, we have attracted dancers with busy work schedules. \nMeeting in the afternoon from 4-7pm, dancers coming from greater distances were able to manage the travel time both before and after the dances. \nOur venue, the Hill and Valley Club, is one of the airiest dance halls in the bay area. \nThese features have allowed us to attract a very diverse multigenerational crowd that is comfortable with our gender-neutral atmosphere. \nDetails at our website. \nWe also have a Facebook group."

    details: "Ruff Ceilidhs – what are they? Well, we always have a live band with a caller who explains the dances. \nOther names for this kind of event include Twmpath, Barn-dance, Country dance and also sometimes e-Ceilidh. \nWhy RUFF? Well it has been described as short for ‘Roll Up For Folk’, but its really just a misspelling of Rough. Dave Parsons was once asked to create a display dance side very quickly, ‘What are you called?’ ‘Well it’s going to be rough…’ \nWhat we do is essentially traditional folk dancing. This does include new dances based on that tradition. You may have read of something like it in Jane Austen or Thomas Hardy.  Nowadays these dances are often seen at weddings, birthdays, PTA fundraisers or even at school. The reason some of these dances have survived for hundreds of years is that they are infectious and great fun. \nIt’s a wonderful way to meet people, mix the generations, get some exercise, laugh a lot and enjoy some really exciting live music."
