These delicious pie slices are offered at the break for $3/slice to help support the band and caller.\nRole terms: “Ladies & Gents” (or Women & Men) but dancers are welcome to choose whatever works best for each dancer.\nClothing & footwear: Clothing is casual; layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged, but some do wear them even though it makes dancing harder)."
