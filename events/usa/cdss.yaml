    details: "New Time: Dance 7:30-10:30pm [basics session 7:15 pm]\nThis is so wicked fun! We dance to the fiddle tunes of Ireland, Scotland, England, France, and Appalachia and we often switch partners after every dance so there is no need to bring a partner, and no experience is needed to have a fantastic time! So come enjoy the friendly camaraderie, dance to live music and see everyone’s smiling faces!\nClothing & Footwear: Clothing is casual, layers are best for this invigorating exercise. Please wear non-street shoes that move easily on the floor (rubber-soled sneakers are discouraged).\nFood: Some snacks offered at the break and contributions are welcome and needed!\nCaller: Billy Fischer. Bill, a well-respected square and contra dance caller, has been calling dances for over thirty years, starting out in New Haven, Connecticut with the contra dance series that has been a fixture of the folk music and dance scene since 1976. In addition to contra dances in and around the northeast, he has called at various dance camps regionally and nationally.\nMuch of his calling activity centers on special occasion “barn” dances including the monthly musical event BMAD at his home in Bethany, CT. Other such events include school dances, private parties, special occasions such as weddings, birthdays and anniversaries, and dances in extended care facilities where he has done dances for people using wheel-chairs and walkers.\nLive Music: Headwaters is made up of Jim and Willow Sirch and Gary Wikfors playing their Swedish nykelharpas, five-string fiddle, Irish blackwood flute, octave mandola, bodhran and banjo. You no doubt know them as members of the venerable New Haven-based band The Fiddleheads that has been playing for New England contra dances for thirty years.\nAdmission: $13.00 per person OR, Students (with ID, please) pay $6. Donations are greatly appreciated and encouraged!\nFree Parking: There is plenty of free parking right in front of the hall.\nRole Terms: “Ladies & Gents” but all dancers are welcome to dance whichever role their heart desires."
