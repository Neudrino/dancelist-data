Please do not ask for exceptions.  Most likely, for everyone’s safety, we will also require negative covid tests (home tests are fine) 2 days before coming and again on the first day. If everyone complies (please do!) then we may be able to make masks optional. We will have a final decision regarding masks and tests 2 weeks prior to the weekend and will notify all registered dancers.  \nIn order to ensure that we have full attendance (and can therefore afford to pay all the expenses), we are asking everyone to register in advance. So if you know you want to come, please register today. Thank you! \n$175. Includes full weekend and all snacks.\nNote:  This weekend is designed for experienced dancers and attendance is limited. We sell out every year, so PLEASE register soon! \nRegister by sending email to FairfolkDancers “at” gmail “dot” com and then send check payable to Jennifer Hamilton to arrive within 5 business days via snail-mail to:\nFFADC PO Box 1321, Fairfield, Iowa 52556 \nPlease include name, address, phone and email.  We sold out way in advance last time and expect to do so for 2023. Your cancelled check is your receipt—please do not be disappointed if you do not get an email acknowledgement. If you enquire by email, you are not registered until we receive your check! The time/date of your email will be the tie-breaker if we sell out on the day we receive your check. \nWe are delighted to welcome Joanna Reiner Wilkinson back to Fairfield. Many of you enjoyed dancing with her in the past and we are fortunate to welcome her again! \nCancellation / Refund Policy: If you need to cancel for any reason, we will allow you to transfer your personal registration to the next year (for one year only). Or you can send someone—a previously unregistered dancer whom you find—in your place to this current year’s weekend and let us know about the substitution. You handle all the details and work out the payment with your friend. This applies only to the specific weekend you paid for. Other than these two options, unfortunately there are no refunds or exchanges. We simply do not have the volunteer staff to handle these complications. (If you have sent your check late and the dance is full, we will not cash your check.) \nLocation: The Morning Star Studio, 51½ S. Court St. Fairfield, Iowa.

    organisation: Montpelier Contra Dance
  - name: Oakstone Trio Concert
    details: "After years of playing together on the Oxford session scene and in folk clubs, The Oakstone Trio came together in early 2022 for Folk Weekend: Oxford.  \nLouis Thurman (melodeons, vocals), Mitch Keely (guitar, vocals), and Joshua Newman (fiddle, viola, vocals) combine a nuanced, improvisatory approach to tunes with energy and warmth, allowing seldom-heard tunes to escape old manuscripts and giving well-loved session tunes the space to find new directions. They pair new compositions with old tunes and solo ballads with harmony chorus songs.  \nPlease note: seating is limited and will only be available for those with pre-booked tickets. We expect this event to be very popular. At times access to Blackwell Hall may be controlled to enable all visitors to enjoy the event."
